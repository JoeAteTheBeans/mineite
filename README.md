# mineite
A Minecraft plugin for 1.16. Built as a MMO RPG style plugin.

This is my first Minecraft Plugin and I honestly have no idea what i'm doing with it.

Mineite is (currentlly) a small plugin that hopes to recreate the MMO RPG style of Minecraft servers in the form of one plugin.

Currently implemented :
Custom Items in the form of a give command.
Custom enchants that can be applied to a item using a command or using the interface that is opened when you right click with a enchanted book.
